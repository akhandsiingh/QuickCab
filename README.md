# QuickCab: Comprehensive Cab Booking Platform

## Project Overview

QuickCab is a full-stack web application that provides a comprehensive cab booking platform similar to popular ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola. The application connects passengers with drivers through an intuitive interface, offering real-time booking, tracking, and management capabilities. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), QuickCab serves three distinct user types: passengers, drivers, and administrators, each with tailored interfaces and functionalities.
